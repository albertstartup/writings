# TSLA loss

Lost about $7 trading $TSLA. I woke up at 6 and saw some notifications that tesla was becoming oversold and overbought.
I'm learning a couple lessons.

## Stop trading $TSLA

At least for the mean time. I'm trading 1 share at a time and every time I trade larger stocks I run the risk of blowing my account sooner. This will also force me to become familiar with medium to smaller cap stocks where my losses are more palatable.

## Beware of fair value

I seem to hope that if a price is at fair value it will soon become overbought and thus racking in profits. It would be better to focus on oversold stocks.

## Learn to use a scanner

I keep procrastinating on this. I'll take some first steps to learn to use the TradingView scanner and learn about liquidity voids in the mean time.

# TQQQ gain

Bought $TQQQ when it was below 31 on the 5 min RSI. Caught a good run up but a bit too late. Made a 0.6 profit. It could have been 1% but I was logging in to Interactive broker and bought a bit later than ideal.
