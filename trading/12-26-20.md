# Coin-Flipping Market Gods

Market prices are random and so we don't try to divine future prices from past prices. Instead we try to understand the properties of the process generating those prices, which include average annual returns and annualized standard deviation.

You then try to control volatility to maximize returns.

It often takes a large number of observations/time to realize an edge.
