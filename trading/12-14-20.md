# Research vs Backtest

It is better to do research into the effects you are interested in than to dive head first into backtesting.

# $XPEV loss

Got stopped out at 2%. Was too focused on the 15min chart and should have waited for an oversold indication on the 5 min chart.

Made an irrational decision to buy near overbought because of FOMO.

I think a 2% stop loss is too high. I think setting 1% stop loss will force me to find better setups.
