# Volatility

"Is the wiggliness of asses prices" or the spread of asset returns
Cannot be measured precisely, but can be estimated as the standard deviation of periodic returns.

The past volatility of an asset is a good prediction of it's future volatility.

Volatility is volatile therefore only a recent prediction of volatility is good prediction of future volatility.

# Volatility Drag

Volatility always hurts our returns

With a constant edge, volatility will drag our returns down.
If our returns are consistent our compound growth rate will be higher.

# Sizing

Volatility scales linearly with your position size.

Returns do not scale linearly with size.

Risk / reward ratio lower with increasing size.

# Volatility Sizing

In theory you can calculate the sizing to maximite growth of your money but not in practice.

Volatility scales linearly with size therefore it is attractive to size bazed on volatility.

# Volatility Targeting

Adjusting sizing to target volatility, volatility smoothing, generally improves performance of equities. This is a nice side effect but the point is that volatility target helps us manage risk at strategy/portfolio level.
