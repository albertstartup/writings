# Hot Module Reloading

Hot module reloading is a feature in CRA that allows code to be replaced without reloading the page.
It is intricate, in that you could specify which code get reload and which don't.
You can even make reducers get hot code reloaded.
```js
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
});

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept('./rootReducer', () => {
    const newRootReducer = require('./rootReducer').default
    store.replaceReducer(newRootReducer)
  })
}
```
