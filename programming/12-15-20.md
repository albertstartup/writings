# Declaring Tab Bankruptcy in Chrome

Over the course of a day I open many tabs. In the past I reached the point of having 300+ tabs open. This was before I had a Mac with an SSD drive; my laptop was slowed to a crippling speed. Over time I have found several tools that allow me to balance having multiple tabs open and performance.

## The Great Suspender

I use the great suspender to kill all the process behind each of my tabs. This instantly clear up 4gb of memory. I bind it to a key sequence.

## Session Buddy

This extension gives me a birds eye view of my open tabs. I have many features I would like to add in addition to making it open source but for now its reviews on the Chrome store will suffice.

## Chrome Profiles

Google stores all of Chrome's data in `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome`. I duplicate the `Chrome` directory into `ChromeBackup`. I then switch the Chrome settings to start every new session with the a new tab. I then restart Chrome. Now I have a clean browser but if I were ever to need the tab history of my previous tabs, I could easily restore the session.

Aside: When writing this I noticed that this step is overkill but does provide the benefit of backing up tab history. If you wish to conserve space, you could skip this step and just restart chrome.
