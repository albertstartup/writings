# Pyenv

I had to setup pyenv for macOS as that is what is recommended online as opposed to brew.

I installed pyenv with brew but still needed to configure my fish shell to work with it.

I just had to append this line.

```sh
status --is-interactive; and source (pyenv init -|psub)
```

The first part just checks that the current shell is an interactive shell, it returns status code 0.

The `;` is not a comment but indicates a new command on the same line.

The `and` keyword is not english but in fact a command.

The `|` symbol is a pipe and `psub` is a command for 'perform process substitution'.

# Pip and SSL

I got this error when trying to use pip.

`WARNING: pip is configured with locations that require TLS/SSL, however the ssl module in Python is not available.`


# Brew

I have not used brew in a long time.

I'm going to try this command to clean it up.

`brew update && brew upgrade`

# Clojure

I started a new project with Clojure today.
