# Redux Toolkit

I am currently playing with Redux Toolkit.

I am learning about createSlice and how it simplifies creating reducers and actionCreators.

createSlice has options on specifying how a payload will be created with the `prepare()` function.

```js
createSlice({
  reducers: {
    addTodo: {
      prepare: (data) => {
        // Create a payload from specified data
        return { payload: { data } };
      },
    },
  },
});
```

# Timekeeper

I'm creating an application that tracks your meditation sessions.

Each meditation session must include a timestamp.

Initially before each test I would manually override date with a new date, but this will not be accurate as I'm relying on a short execution time.

```js
it("should handle addEntry", () => {
  // Update the date and hope the test gets executed immediately
  let date = new Date();
  expect(entries([], addEntry(5))).toEqual([
    {
      id: 0,
      amount: 5,
      date,
    },
  ]);
});
```

I then discovered that you could freeze time with `timekeeper` as to make it more consistent.
```js
let date: Date;
beforeEach(() => {
  date = new Date();
  // Time is frozen so that they are consistent
  tk.freeze(date);
});

afterEach(() => {
  tk.reset();
});

describe("addEntry", () => {
  it("should generate incrementing todo IDs", () => {
    const action1 = addEntry(5);
    const action2 = addEntry(10);

    // This date is the same date as when initialized above
    expect(action1.payload).toEqual({ id: 0, amount: 5, date });
    expect(action2.payload).toEqual({ id: 1, amount: 10, date });
  });
});
```

# useDispatch

react-redux now has a Hooks API which provides an alternative to the connect API
