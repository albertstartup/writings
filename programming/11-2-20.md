# Globalized Redux Selectors

You can make selectors that know the location of the entity slice within the redux application state.

```js
const selectors = entryAdapter.getSelectors(
  (state: RootState) => state.entries
);
```

# Redux-Persist storage swapping
When using Redux-Persist you can use a unique key in the config object so that you can swap between real and test data.

```js
const persistConfig = {
  key: "root",
  key: "meditation-tracker-root-test",
  storage,
};
```
