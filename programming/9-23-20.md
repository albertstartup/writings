# useSelectors

Redux now has a useSelector api, which can be combined with reselector.

You can use createSelector to create a selector which you can then pass to useSelector.

```js
const entriesSelector = createSelector(
  (state: RootState) => state.entries,
  selectAll
);
const entries = useSelector(entriesSelector);
```
